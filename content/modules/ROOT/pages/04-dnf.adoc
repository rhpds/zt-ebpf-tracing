== Observe `+dnf+` Update

Time to observe what happens when `+dnf+` does an update from a system perspective! In the `+dnf+` tab run:

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf update -y
----

The first thing that `+dnf+` does is updates repository metadata. This is going to create activity on your `+gethostlatency+` terminal and your `+tcplife+` terminal as the data is being downloaded from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN). You can look at those tool outputs to see the network connections that the `+dnf update+` establishes in real time.

You will see entries on our `+gethostlatency+` tab similar to:

.Entries on the `+gethostlatency+` tab
image::latency_satellite.png[latency_satellite.png]

These show `+dnf+` looking up IP addresses for localhost, subscription.rhsm.redhat.com, and cdn.redhat.com. `+gethostlatency+` makes it really easy to know what hosts our application is talking to.

Also look at the _cachestat_ tab and you should see output similar to:

.Entries on the `+cachestat+` tab
image::latency_cache.png[cachestat.png]

This shows that you are operating entirely on system cache and not having to retrieve data from storage at this point in the operation.

Look at your _tcplife_ tab when `+dnf+` has finished downloading packages. You will see output similar to the sample below:

.Entries on the `+tcplife+` tab
image::tcplife_dnf.png[tcplife_dnf.png]

The output shows you that `+dnf+` has established a connection on port 443 to IP address 52.14.50.151. Further, according to the sample output above, you can observer the connection time in milliseconds. This correlates to the amount of time `+dnf+` spent downloading packages.
