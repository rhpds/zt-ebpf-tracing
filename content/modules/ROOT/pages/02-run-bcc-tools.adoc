== Run eBPF Tools

In this step, you will start running the bcc-tools to prepare for
observing an active workload on the system. In the lab environment there
are several additional terminal tabs across the top of the interface,
the names correspond to tools that you will run in this, and following
steps.

First, you will validate the environment and that it is not currently
using any eBPF calls. To do this, you will install the `+bpftool+`
utility.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y bpftool
----

Next, run `+bpftool+` to see what eBPF programs are currently loaded in
the kernel. If there are no eBPF programs in use, the tool will return
no output.

[source,bash,run]
----
bpftool prog list | grep -A 3 cgroup
----

The tool likely provided output, similar to that displayed above. Reviewing that output, the eBPF tools already running are related to the cgroup2 implementation on the machine. You will add to this list by launching additional tools, but is always good to know what is already in-place on the system before adding additional tooling to the machine.

Now, observe the tabs for the terminal.

Click on the tab `+gethostlatency+`.

.Click on the tab `+gethostlatency+`
image::gethostlatencytab.png[gethostlatencytab.png]

The tool `+gethostlatency+` has been launched for you by running `+/usr/share/bcc/tools/gethostlatency+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
/usr/share/bcc/tools/gethostlatency
----

The `+gethostlatency+` bcc-tool is showing latency statistics on the `+getaddrinfo()+` and `+gethostbyname()+` system calls. Effectively, you get to see how long these system calls take and which hostnames the applications need IP addresses for. This can be useful for discovering network connections that your applications are making.

Next, click on the tab `+tcplife+`.

.Click on the tab `+tcplife+`
image::tcplifetab.png[tcplifetab.png]

`+tcplife+` was launched with the following command:

[source,bash,run]
----
/usr/share/bcc/tools/tcplife
----

The following header should now be displayed in the _tcplife_ terminal,
indicating the tool is running:

`+tcplife+` will tell you data about established tcp connections. PID is the process ID of the process opening the connection. COMM, the command that corresponds to the PID. LADDR and LPORT reference the local address and port of the connection. RADDR and RPORT the remote address and port. TX_KB and RX_KB are the amount of data Transmitted (in Kilobytes) and Received (in Kilobytes). MS is the time of the connection, in milliseconds.
