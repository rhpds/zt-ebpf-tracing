eBPF is an in-kernel virtual machine that allows code execution in the
kernel space, in a restricted sandbox environment with access to a
limited set of functions. The virtual machine executes special
assembly-like code. The code is then loaded in the kernel and translated
to the native machine code with just-in-time compilation. There are
numerous components shipped by Red Hat that utilize the eBPF virtual
machine.

The bcc-tools package provides many pre-created tools that provide data
from functions built with eBPF.

First, in the *dnf* terminal tab, install the kernel-devel package for
your currently running kernel and the bcc-tools packages.

Enter the following command:

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y kernel-devel-$(uname -r) bcc-tools
----

____
*Note:* In the command above, we embed the `+uname -r+` command to
automatically determine, and embed, the version of the currently running
kernel.

Next, inspect the content of the bcc-tools package to see some of the
pre-built tool catalog that is provided. Each of these tools has a
`+man+` page which provides details on what data the tool produces as
well as any options that may be used when running the tool.

[source,bash,run]
----
rpm -ql bcc-tools | grep /usr/share/bcc/tools/
----

You will be working with several of these tools in the next steps. The
tools provided by the bcc-tools package are installed in the
/usr/share/bcc/tools directory.
